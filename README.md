# ClickerHeroesScripts
Hacky super smart script for Clicker Heroes 1.0

CTRL-g     to star the script
CTRL-ALT-p to pause/continue the script

#Limitation of the script
1. needs Clicker Heroes to be running at a maximum resolution but not full screen
2. or in another 1920x1080 window with a taskbar at the bottom of your screen or top
3. script uses several hard coded X/Y position that are relative to Clicker Heroes app, thus the app must remain in focus at all times
4. script only supports one target gild, which you have to specify in the beginning of the script via row/column
 
#TODO
1. support multiple target gilds
2. there are issues when target gild is too high up the list
3. there are issues detecting when the target goal is completely reach and there are no wrong gilds left
